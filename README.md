# Margin Calendar

A calendar for Google Calendar on macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. The grid owns the window, the day
fits without scrolling, and on a desktop the whole thing is drivable from the keyboard.

It is a sibling to [margin](https://github.com/priyanshujain/margin) and shares its stack and its
visual language.

`just install` builds it and installs it on the machine you are on. On Linux,
`nix profile install github:priyanshujain/margin-calendar` installs the released build instead.
Setup and the Google OAuth client it needs are in [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md), and the extra
clients a phone build needs are in [docs/mobile.md](docs/mobile.md). How releases are cut and how
the Nix package is made are in [docs/release.md](docs/release.md). The product decisions are in
[docs/design.md](docs/design.md), how it is built is in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md),
and the conventions it follows are in [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md).
